# Configuring GraphRAG Indexing

The GraphRAG system is highly configurable. This page provides an overview of the configuration options available for the GraphRAG indexing engine.

## Default Configuration Mode

The default configuration mode is the simplest way to get started with the GraphRAG system. It is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration. The primary configuration sections for the Indexing Engine pipelines are described below. The main ways to set up GraphRAG in Default Configuration mode are via:

- [Init command](init.md) (recommended)
- [Purely using environment variables](env_vars.md)
- [Using JSON or YAML for deeper control](json_yaml.md)

## Custom Configuration Mode

Custom configuration mode is an advanced use-case. Most users will want to use the Default Configuration instead. The primary configuration sections for Indexing Engine pipelines are described below. Details about how to use custom configuration are available in the [Custom Configuration Mode](custom.md) documentation.
