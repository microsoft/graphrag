    Apply a layout algorithm to a nx.Graph. The method returns a dataframe containing the node positions.

    ## Usage
    ```yaml
    args:
        graph: The nx.Graph to layout
        embeddings: Embeddings for each node in the graph
        strategy: <strategy config> # See strategies section below
    ```

    ## Strategies
    The layout graph verb uses a strategy to layout the graph. The strategy is a json object which defines the strategy to use. The following strategies are available:

    ### umap
    This strategy uses the umap algorithm to layout a graph. The strategy config is as follows:
    ```yaml
    strategy:
        type: umap
        n_neighbors: 5 # Optional, The number of neighbors to use for the umap algorithm, default: 5
        min_dist: 0.75 # Optional, The min distance to use for the umap algorithm, default: 0.75
    ```
