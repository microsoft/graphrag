-Goal-
Given a json document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

The document contains at least one email and each email with the following information:
- "index" which is a number
- "from" which is the email address of the sender
- "to" which is a list of the email addresses of the recipients. Each email address is separated by a , character
- "subject" which is the subject of the email
- "date" which is the date that the email has been composed
- "body" which is the textual content of the email written by the sender


-Steps-
For each email, do steps 1 through 5:
1. Identify the email address of the sender and consider it an EMAIL entity
2. Identify the email addresses of the all the recipients and consider each one an EMAIL entity
3. Identify the date the email has been sent
4. Identify all entities in the email body

For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
5. From the entities identified in steps 1 through 4, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in previous steps
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in previous steps
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

After you have extracted the requested information:
1. Return output in English as list of all the entities and relationships identified in previous steps. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter
2. Output {completion_delimiter} after the list of all entities
