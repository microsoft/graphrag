GraphRAG is a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation system that uses knowledge graphs to enhance LLM outputs. It extracts structured data from unstructured text using the power of large language models.

The system works by:
1. Processing input documents and extracting entities and relationships
2. Building a knowledge graph from the extracted information
3. Creating community reports and embeddings
4. Enabling semantic search across the knowledge graph

GraphRAG was developed by Microsoft Research and supports various LLM providers including OpenAI and Google Gemini.
