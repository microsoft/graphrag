## Overview

The GraphRAG project is a data pipeline and transformation suite that is designed to extract meaningful, structured data from unstructured text using the power of LLMs.

To learn more about GraphRAG and how it can be used to enhance your LLM's ability to reason about your private data, please visit the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/graphrag-unlocking-llm-discovery-on-narrative-private-data/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Blog Post.</a>

## Quickstart

To get started with the GraphRAG system we recommend trying the [Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-accelerator) package. This provides a user-friendly end-to-end experience with Azure resources.

## Repository Guidance

This repository presents a methodology for using knowledge graph memory structures to enhance LLM outputs. Please note that the provided code serves as a demonstration and is not an officially supported Microsoft offering.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Warning: GraphRAG indexing can be an expensive operation, please read all of the documentation to understand the process and costs involved, and start small.*
