## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).
See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for more information.

## Before you start, file an issue

Please follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted effort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's time - yours, ours, and other community members':

> 👉 If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work to fix/implement it.

### Search existing issues first

Before filing a new issue, search existing open and closed issues first: This project is moving fast! It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on or have already contributed a fix!

If no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:

### File a new Issue

- Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? File an issue
- Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, videos, etc.? File an issue
- Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? File an issue
- Got a great idea for a new feature? File an issue/request/idea
- Don't understand how to do something? File an issue
- Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.

If from the previous guide you find yourself in the need of file an Issue please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag/issues).
Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the problem.

### Add information

**Complete the new Issue form, providing as much information as possible**. The more information you provide, the more likely your issue/ask will be understood and implemented. Helpful information includes:

- What device you're running (inc. CPU type, memory, disk, etc.)
- What OS your device is running
- What tools and apps you're using (e.g. VS 2022, VSCode, etc.)
- **We LOVE detailed repro steps!** What steps do we need to take to reproduce the issue? Assume we love to read repro steps. As much detail as you can stand is probably _barely_ enough detail for us!
- Prefer error message text where possible or screenshots of errors if text cannot be captured
- **If you intend to implement the fix/feature yourself then say so!** If you do not indicate otherwise we will assume that the issue is our to solve, or may label the issue as `Help-Wanted`.

### DO NOT post "+1" comments

> ⚠ DO NOT post "+1", "me too", or similar comments - they just add noise to an issue.

If you don't have any additional info/context to add but would like to indicate that you're affected by the issue, upvote the original issue by clicking its [+😊] button and hitting 👍 (+1) icon. This way we can actually measure how impactful an issue is.
